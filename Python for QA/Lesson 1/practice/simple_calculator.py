# 1. Declare a number and store 11
# 2. Declare another number and store 5
# 3. Calculate and print out sum of the  numbers
# 4. Calculate and print out difference of the 2 numbers
# 5. Calculate and print out product of the 2 numbers
# 6. Calculate and print out quotient of the 2 numbers
# 7. Calculate and print out integer division of the 2 numbers
# 8. Calculate and print out remainder of the 2 numbers

# 9. change numbers in the code and run the program for the different numbers

# Output format:

# sum = 16
# difference = 6
# product = 55
# quotient = 2.2
# integer division = 2
# remainder = 1
