# Write a program that converts USD to AMD

# declare a variable and store user's dollar amount - 500
# declare another variable and store the exchange rate - 477.5
# calculate and print out the exchanged amount in AMD: 238650.0

# test your program with following test cases:

# case 1: when USD amount = 100, AMD amount = 47730.0
# case 2: when USD amount = 250, AMD amount = 19325.0

dollar_amount = 250
exchange_rate = 477.3
amd_amount = dollar_amount * exchange_rate
print(amd_amount)
